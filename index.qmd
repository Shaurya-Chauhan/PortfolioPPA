## About Me
Shaurya Chauhan, MCP 1st Year, Architect with 5 years of professional experience in the urban development space.
I am interested in the urban innovation space. Coding is thus a skill I'm interested in learning now- ideally at the intersection between tech and urban development- as well as its policy and ethical implications- which this course enables.
